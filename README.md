This is the official repository for the paper ["ELTEX: A Framework for Domain-Driven Synthetic Data Generation"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15055). ELTEX is a framework that generates high-quality synthetic training data by systematically extracting domain-specific knowledge, enabling resource-efficient models to achieve GPT-4-competitive performance in specialized domains.

## ELTEX Sheets: Build Synthetic Datasets in Google Sheets
We've developed a full-featured Google Sheets add-on that brings our framework directly to users! Currently used internally and coming soon for public release! Stay tuned for updates :shipit:

### Key Features
- No-Code Data Generation: Generate and manage domain-specific datasets directly in Google Sheets
- User-Friendly: Designed for students, teachers, and domain experts with minimal programming experience
- Full Workflow Support: From parameters â†’ indicators â†’ synthetic data â†’ QA â†’ export, all in your spreadsheet

## ðŸ¤— Datasets
- [12k Synthetic Social Media Messages for Early Cyberattack Detection on Blockchain](https://huggingface.co/datasets/dn-institute/cyberattack-blockchain-synth)
### Attack Type Distribution

| **Attack Vectors** | **Seed Examples** | 
|-------------------|------------------------|
| Social Engineering & Phishing | Credential theft, wallet phishing | 
| Smart Contract Exploits | Token claim vulnerabilities, flash loans | 
| Exchange Security Breaches | Hot wallet compromises, key theft |
| DeFi Protocol Attacks | Liquidity pool manipulation, bridge exploits |
